for details.

Let's take these projects to the next level together! ðŸš€

## Quickstart example

Once [installed](#install), you can use the following code to stream messages
from any Server-Sent Events (SSE) server endpoint:

```
data: {"name":"Alice","message":"Hello everybody!"}

data: {"name":"Bob","message":"Hey Alice!"}

data: {"name":"Carol","message":"Nice to see you Alice!"}

data: {"name":"Alice","message":"What a lovely chat!"}

data: {"name":"Bob","message":"All powered by ReactPHP, such an awesome piece of technology :)"}
```

```php
$es = new Clue\React\EventSource\EventSource('https://example.com/stream.php');

$es->on('message', function (Clue\React\EventSource\MessageEvent $message) {
    $json = json_decode($message->data);
    echo $json->name . ': ' . $json->message . PHP_EOL;
});
```

See the [examples](examples/).

## Usage

### EventSource

The `EventSource` class is responsible for communication with the remote Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoint.

The `EventSource` object works very similar to the one found in common
web browsers. Unless otherwise noted, it follows the same semantics as defined
under https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/server-sent-events.html

Its constructor simply requires the URL to the remote Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoint:

```php
$es = new Clue\React\EventSource\EventSource('https://example.com/stream.php');
```

If you need custom connector settings (DNS resolution, TLS parameters, timeouts,
proxy servers etc.), you can explicitly pass a custom instance of the
[`ConnectorInterface`](https://github.com/reactphp/socket#connectorinterface)
to the [`Browser`](https://github.com/reactphp/http#browser) instance
and pass it as an additional argument to the `EventSource` like this:

```php
$connector = new React\Socket\Connector([
    'dns' => '127.0.0.1',
    'tcp' => [
        'bindto' => '192.168.10.1:0'
    ],
    'tls' => [
        'verify_peer' => false,
        'verify_peer_name' => false
    ]
]);
$browser = new React\Http\Browser($connector);

$es = new Clue\React\EventSource\EventSource('https://example.com/stream.php', $browser);
```

This class takes an optional `LoopInterface|null $loop` parameter that can be used to
pass the event loop instance to use for this object. You can use a `null` value
here in order to use the [default loop](https://github.com/reactphp/event-loop#loop).
This value SHOULD NOT be given unless you're sure you want to explicitly use a
given event loop instance.

#### message event

The `message` event will be emitted whenever an EventSource message is received.

```php
$es->on('message', function (Clue\React\EventSource\MessageEvent $message) {
    // $json = json_decode($message->data);
    var_dump($message);
});
```

The EventSource stream may emit any number of messages over its lifetime. Each
`message` event will receive a [`MessageEvent` object](#messageevent).

The [`MessageEvent::$data` property](#messageeventdata) can be used to access
the message payload data. It is commonly used for transporting structured data
such as JSON:

```
data: {"name":"Alice","age":30}

data: {"name":"Bob","age":50}
```
```php
$es->on('message', function (Clue\React\EventSource\MessageEvent $message) {
    $json = json_decode($message->data);
    echo "{$json->name} is {$json->age} years old" . PHP_EOL;
});
```

The EventSource stream may specify an event type for each incoming message. This
`event` field can be used to emit appropriate event types like this:

```
data: Alice
event: join

data: Hello!
event: chat

data: Bob
event: leave
```
```php
$es->on('join', function (Clue\React\EventSource\MessageEvent $message) {
    echo $message->data . ' joined' . PHP_EOL;
});

$es->on('chat', function (Clue\React\EventSource\MessageEvent $message) {
    echo 'Message: ' . $message->data . PHP_EOL;
});

$es->on('leave', function (Clue\React\EventSource\MessageEvent $message) {
    echo $message->data . ' left' . PHP_EOL;
});
```

See also [`MessageEvent::$type` property](#messageeventtype) for more details.

#### open event

The `open` event will be emitted when the EventSource connection is successfully established.

```php
$es->on('open', function () {
    echo 'Connection opened' . PHP_EOL;
});
```

Once the EventSource connection is open, it may emit any number of
[`message` events](#message-event).

If the connection can not be opened successfully, it will emit an
[`error` event](#error-event) instead.

#### error event

The `error` event will be emitted when the EventSource connection fails.
The event receives a single `Exception` argument for the error instance.

```php
$redis->on('error', function (Exception $e) {
    echo 'Error: ' . $e->getMessage() . PHP_EOL;
});
```

The EventSource connection will be retried automatically when it is temporarily
disconnected. If the server sends a non-successful HTTP status code or an
invalid `Content-Type` response header, the connection will fail permanently.

```php
$es->on('error', function (Exception $e) use ($es) {
    if ($es->readyState === Clue\React\EventSource\EventSource::CLOSED) {
        echo 'Permanent error: ' . $e->getMessage() . PHP_EOL;
    } else {
        echo 'Temporary error: ' . $e->getMessage() . PHP_EOL;
    }
});
```

See also the [`EventSource::$readyState` property](#eventsourcereadystate).

#### EventSource::$readyState

The `int $readyState` property can be used to
check the current EventSource connection state.

The state is read-only and can be in one of three states over its lifetime:

* `EventSource::CONNECTING`
* `EventSource::OPEN`
* `EventSource::CLOSED`

#### EventSource::$url

The `readonly string $url` property can be used to
get the EventSource URL as given to the constructor.

#### close()

The `close(): void` method can be used to
forcefully close the EventSource connection.

This will close any active connections or connection attempts and go into the
`EventSource::CLOSED` state.

### MessageEvent

The `MessageEvent` class represents an incoming EventSource message.

#### MessageEvent::$data

The `readonly string $data` property can be used to
access the message payload data.

```
data: hello
```
```php
assert($message->data === 'hello');
```

The `data` field may also span multiple lines. This is commonly used for
transporting structured data such as JSON:

```
data: {
data:     "message": "hello"
data: }
```
```php
$json = json_decode($message->data);
assert($json->message === 'hello');
```

If the message does not contain a `data` field or the `data` field is empty, the
message will be discarded without emitting an event.

#### MessageEvent::$lastEventId

The `readonly string $lastEventId` property can be used to
access the last event ID.

```
data: hello
id: 1
```
```php
assert($message->data === 'hello');
assert($message->lastEventId === '1');
```

Internally, the `id` field will automatically be used as the `Last-Event-ID` HTTP
request header in case the connection is interrupted.

If the message does not contain an `id` field, the `$lastEventId` property will
be the value of the last ID received. If no previous message contained an ID, it
will default to an empty string.

#### MessageEvent::$type

The `readonly string $type` property can be used to
access the message event type.

```
data: Alice
event: join
```
```php
assert($message->data === 'Alice');
assert($message->type === 'join');
```

Internally, the `event` field will be used to emit the appropriate event type.
See also [`message` event](#message-event).

If the message does not contain a `event` field or the `event` field is empty,
the `$type` property will default to `message`.
